================================
(addition of mystery genre)  You are an astronautical magic skeptic sent to a Grimm setting village by a nervous ruler to investigate claims of Grimm style danger.  You have been sent with a squad since the ruler does not trust the eyes of only one person, fearing the alien magic will corrupt your judgement.  The village was formed around an old colony started by humans who nearly all died due to a lack of discipline and now believe in the Grimm tales as gospel.  It is your job to figure out if the village / world has actual magic properties, or if it is a result of something natural, or if it is deception by the cult.  Your task is made more difficult by multiple platforming intensive, disturbing psychological experiences, with possible clues as to the cause of the disturbances.  The game is open world to allow clue discovery through problem solving and player voilition.
