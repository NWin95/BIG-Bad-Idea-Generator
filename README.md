BIG-Bad-Idea-Generator
======================

Starting adds 5 random ideas to the main text file, pressing space adds five more

In the "Best Results" text file ideas are there either for being an actually good idea or being an interesting design experiment,
the interesting experiments could still make good games, it just seems like more of a challenge / stretch
